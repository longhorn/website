                    <p>
                        <strong>SUSE Storage</strong> is an enterprise distribution built on Longhorn — combining the simplicity and agility of the community project with SUSE’s proven enterprise expertise. It provides production-ready support, performance optimizations, and lifecycle management for clusters running in demanding environments. SUSE Storage creates a dedicated storage controller for each block device volume and synchronously replicates the volume across multiple replicas stored on multiple nodes. The storage controller and replicas are themselves orchestrated using Kubernetes, ensuring resilience and scalability.
