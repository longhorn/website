                    <p>
                        <strong>Longhorn</strong> is a vendor-neutral, open-source project under the
                        <a href="https://www.cncf.io" target="_blank">Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)</a>.
                        Contributions from individuals, users, and organizations worldwide drive its success.
                        Enterprise distributions, such as <strong>SUSE Storage</strong>, are built on top of Longhorn,
                        helping expand its adoption and reliability in production environments — while the upstream community continues to innovate openly.
                    </p>
