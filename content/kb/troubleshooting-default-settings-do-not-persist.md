## Applicable versions

Longhorn version < v1.3.0.

## Symptoms

* When upgrading Longhorn system via helm or Rancher App, the modified Longhorn default settings doesn't persist.

* When modifying the default settings via `kubectl -n longhorn-system edit configmap longhorn-default-setting`, the modification won't be applied to the Longhorn system.

## Background

This default setting is only for a Longhorn system that hasnâ€™t been deployed. It has no impact on an existing Longhorn system. 

## Solution

We recommend using the Longhorn UI to change Longhorn setting on the existing cluster.

You can also use the `kubectl`, but please be aware **this will bypass Longhorn backend validation**.
```
kubectl edit settings <SETTING-NAME> -n longhorn-system
```
