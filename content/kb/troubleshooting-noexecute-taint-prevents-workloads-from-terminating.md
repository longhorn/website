## Applicable versions

All Longhorn versions.

## Symptoms

Applying a `NoExecute` taint to a node causes all pods on that node that cannot tolerate the taint to terminate. Users
may expect pods using Longhorn volumes and managed by a controller (e.g. Deployment pods) to be able to restart on
different nodes after the taint is applied. However, the replacement pods remain `ContainerCreating` and the old pods
remain `Terminating` indefinitely.

For example, after applying a taint to the node running this Deployment pod, the cluster remains in the following state.

```
eweber@laptop:~/> kubectl taint node eweber-v126-worker-9c1451b4-kgxdq k=v:NoExecute
node/eweber-v126-worker-9c1451b4-kgxdq tainted

eweber@laptop:~/website> kubectl get pod -owide
mysql-56c8c6775b-8f5gh                 0/1     Terminating         0                30m    10.42.2.58        eweber-v126-worker-9c1451b4-kgxdq   <none>           <none>
mysql-56c8c6775b-rph8k                 0/1     ContainerCreating   0                28m    <none>            eweber-v126-worker-9c1451b4-rw5hf   <none>           <none>
```

Describing the replacement pod reveals the immediate cause for the lack of progress.

```
...
eweber@laptop:~/> kubectl describe pod mysql-56c8c6775b-rph8k
Warning  FailedAttachVolume  27m   attachdetach-controller  Multi-Attach error for volume "pvc-b23fce3b-cada-43a9-89b8-2eb9b97e39c9" Volume is already exclusively attached to one node and can't be attached to another
```

## Root cause

The above Multi-Attach error is generated by Kubernetes, not Longhorn. Kubernetes will not create a VolumeAttachment
requesting Longhorn attach the volume to a new node until it is detached from the old one. Currently, there is only
one VolumeAttachment for the volume in the cluster, and it still references the old node.

```
eweber@laptop:~/> kubectl get volumeattachment
csi-f1a6eae2f691ad48e39aca528454c64f7c46a3e6c446e6f9a8ecd960895bf0b6   driver.longhorn.io   pvc-b23fce3b-cada-43a9-89b8-2eb9b97e39c9   eweber-v126-worker-9c1451b4-kgxdq   true       31m
```

In fact, Kubernetes will not attempt to delete this old VolumeAttachment until kubelet on the old node reports that all
pods using the volume have been successfully torn down. As long as the old pod is stuck `Terminating`, no progress can
be made.

The kubelet logs on the old node reveal the reason for the long termination.

```

The pod can't be torn down because the Longhorn CSI plugin is no longer registered with kubelet. It is the plugin's
responsibility to ensure that Longhorn volumes are unmounted safely. But in this cluster, Longhorn has not been
configured to tolerate the applied `NoExecute` taint. This has caused Longhorn pods (including the Longhorn CSI plugin
pod) to terminate. No progress can be made without a running Longhorn CSI plugin on the node.

```
eweber@laptop:~/> kubectl -n longhorn-system get pod -owide | grep eweber-v126-worker-9c1451b4-kgxdq
# Empty...
```

## Best practices

If you plan to apply `NoExecute` taints to nodes that run Longhorn volumes, [configure
Longhorn](../../docs/1.7.0/advanced-resources/deploy/taint-toleration/) to tolerate them. This is
best done at install time, as tolerations cannot be updated while volumes are attached.

If you need to apply a `NoExecute` taint and cannot change the taint toleration setting before, drain the node first and
then apply the intended taint. This gives all workloads consuming Longhorn volumes the opportunity to migrate to other
nodes. When the `NoExecute` taint is applied, there is no longer a need for Longhorn components to run on the tainted
node.

## Workaround

If you already applied a `NoExecute` taint that Longhorn can't tolerate and are stuck in the situation described, there
are two options.

1. Remove the `NoExecute` taint and wait for the situation to resolve itself. Once the Longhorn CSI plugin restarts on
   the old node, pod termination will complete successfully. Then, follow the best practices above.
2. Detach all volumes and [configure
   Longhorn](../../docs/1.7.0/advanced-resources/deploy/taint-toleration/) to tolerate the applied
   taint. This is likely not the preferred solution, but it may be appropriate in some circumstances.
