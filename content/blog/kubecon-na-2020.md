Hi Longhorn community members,

The holiday season is almost there, and Longhorn is going to the KubeCon + CloudNativeCon NA Virtual 2020 next week!

I know, I know, it just has been three months after the last KubeCon. But many things has happened, including a delayed Longhorn v1.1.0 release...

At this moment, the Longhorn team is still busy working on bringing the best possible v1.1.0 release to you.

So how about join us during the KubeCon NA 2020 and take a look at the things we're excited about for the upcoming v1.1.0 release?

You can find our booth at Expo Hall -> Project Pavilion.
