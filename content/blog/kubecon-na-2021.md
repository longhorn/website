Hi Longhorn community members,

Longhorn is going to the KubeCon North America 2021 in 10/11 - 10/15 to serve community users as usual!

This time is different than the previous virtual conferences caused by heavy COVID impact. KubeCon will provide in-person and virtual options for visitors to attend. We will have an in-person booth for your visits to have chances to interact with our maintainers to discuss the roadmap, features, questions, ideas, consults, contributions, etc.

Besides, we will have an office hours session for you to learn more about our new release 1.2 and Q&A with our maintainers.

## Office Hours

Monday, October 11, 9:00am - 9:45am Pacific Daylight Time (UTC -7)

[Register here](https://sched.co/mtJ9)

## Survey

During the conference, we will have a survey ([here](https://forms.office.com/r/t1bRvUCXXj)) for the visitors to the Longhorn booth. Every respondent will have a chance to win some cool Longhorn swags, including Longhorn logo T-Shirts. We will draw 10 winners per day from October 13th to 15th.

Looking forward to meeting everyone in the KubeCon NA 2021!
