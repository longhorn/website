  <h2>Why Use Longhorn</h2>
  <div class="grid-three">
    <div>
      <h5>Highly available persistent storage for Kubernetes</h5> 
      <p>In the past, ITOps and DevOps have found it hard to add replicated storage to Kubernetes clusters. As a result many non-cloud-hosted Kubernetes clusters don’t support persistent storage. External storage arrays are non-portable and can be extremely expensive.</p>

      <p>Longhorn delivers simplified, easy to deploy and upgrade, 100% open source, cloud-native persistent block storage without the cost overhead of open core or proprietary alternatives.</p>
    </div>
      
    <div>
      <h5>Easy incremental snapshots and backups</h5>
      <p>Longhorn’s scheduled snap and clone features make it possible for developers to work with the currently-active datastore from their production environments.</p>
      <p>Performing regular backups of persistent storage volumes in Kubernetes clusters is simplified with Longhorn’s intuitive, free management UI.</p>

    </div>

    <div>
      <h5>Reliable multi-cluster replication</h5>
      <p>External replication solutions will recover from a disk failure by re-replicating the entire data store. This can take days, during which time the cluster performs poorly and has a higher risk of failure.</p>

      <p>Using Longhorn, you can easily create a read-only remote replica volume in another Kubernetes cluster and fail over to it in the event of an emergency.</p>

      <p>If your main cluster fails, Longhorn  can set the replica to RW and bring up the app in the DR cluster quickly.</p>
