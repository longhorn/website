## Removal

### `longhorn.io/v1beta1` API

The `v1beta1` Longhorn API version was removed in v1.10.0.

For more details, see [Issue #10249](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/10249).

### `replica.status.evictionRequested` Field

The deprecated `replica.status.evictionRequested` field has been removed.

For more details, see [Issue #7022](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/7022)

## General

### Kubernetes Version Requirement

Due to the upgrade of the CSI external snapshotter to v8.2.0, all clusters must be running Kubernetes v1.25 or later before you can upgrade to Longhorn v1.8.0 or a newer version.

### CRD Upgrade Validation

During an upgrade, a new Longhorn manager may start before the Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) are applied. This sequencing ensures the controller does not process objects containing deprecated data or fields. However, it can cause the Longhorn manager to fail during the initial upgrade phase if the CRD has not yet been applied.

If the Longhorn manager crashes during the upgrade, check the logs to determine if the failure is due to the CRD not being applied. In such cases, the logs may contain error messages similar to the following:

```
time="2025-03-27T06:59:55Z" level=fatal msg="Error starting manager: upgrade resources failed: BackingImage in version \"v1beta2\" cannot be handled as a BackingImage: strict decoding error: unknown field \"spec.diskFileSpecMap\", unknown field \"spec.diskSelector\", unknown field \"spec.minNumberOfCopies\", unknown field \"spec.nodeSelector\", unknown field \"spec.secret\", unknown field \"spec.secretNamespace\"" func=main.main.DaemonCmd.func3 file="daemon.go:94"
```

### Upgrade Check Events

When upgrading via Helm or Rancher App Marketplace, Longhorn performs pre-upgrade checks. If a check fails, the upgrade stops, and the reason for the failure is recorded in an event.

For more detail, see [Upgrading Longhorn Manager](../deploy/upgrade/longhorn-manager).

### Manual Checks Before Upgrade

Automated pre-upgrade checks do not cover all scenarios. Manual checks via kubectl or the UI are recommended:

- Ensure all V2 Data Engine volumes are detached and replicas are stopped. The V2 engine does not support live upgrades.
- Avoid upgrading when volumes are "Faulted", as unusable replicas may be deleted, causing permanent data loss if no backups exist.
- Avoid upgrading if a failed BackingImage exists. See [Backing Image](../advanced-resources/backing-image/backing-image) for details.
- Creating a [Longhorn system backup](../advanced-resources/system-backup-restore/backup-longhorn-system) before upgrading is recommended to ensure recoverability.

### Consolidation of Longhorn Settings

Settings have been consolidated for easier management across V1 and V2 Data Engines. Each setting now uses one of the following formats:

- Single value for all supported Data Engines
  - Format: Non-JSON string (e.g., `1024`)
  - The value applies to all supported Data Engines and must be the same across them.
  - Data-engine-specific values are not allowed.
- Data-engine-specific values for V1 and V2 Data Engines
  - Format: JSON object (e.g., `{"v1": "value1", "v2": "value2"}`)
  - Allows specifying different values for V1 and V2 Data Engines.
- Data-engine-specific values for V1 Data Engine only
  - Format: JSON object with `v1` key only (e.g., `{"v1": "value1"}`)
  - Only the V1 Data Engine can be configured; the V2 Data Engine is not affected.
- Data-engine-specific values for V2 Data Engine only
  - Format: JSON object with `v2` key only (e.g., `{"v2": "value1"}`)
  - Only the V2 Data Engine can be configured; the V1 Data Engine is not affected.

For more information, see [Longhorn Settings](../references/settings).

### System Info Category in Setting

A new **System Info** category has been added to show cluster-level information more clearly.

For more details, see [Issue #11656](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/11656)

### Volume Attachment Summary

The UI now display a summary of attachment tickets on each volume overview page for improved visibility into volume state.

For more details, see [Issue #11400](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/11400) and [Issue #11401](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/11401).

## Scheduling

### Pod Scheduling with CSIStorageCapacity

Longhorn now supports Kubernetes **CSIStorageCapacity**, which enables the scheduler to verify node storage before scheduling pods that use StorageClasses with **WaitForFirstConsumer**.

This reduces scheduling errors and improves reliability.

For more information, see [GitHub Issue #10685](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/10685)

## Performance

### Configurable Backup Block Size

Starting in Longhorn v1.10.0,  backup block size can be configured when creating a volume, allowing optimization for performance, efficiency, and cost.

For more information, see [Create Longhorn Volumes](../nodes-and-volumes/volumes/create-volumes).

### Profiling Support for Backup Sync Agent

The backup sync agent exposes a `pprof` server for profiling runtime resource usage during backup sync operations.

For more information, see [Profiling](../troubleshoot/troubleshooting#profiling).

## Resilience

### Configurable Liveness Probe for Instance Manager

You can now configure the instance-manager pod liveness probes. This allows the system to better distinguish between temporary delays and actual failures, which helps reduce unnecessary restarts and improves overall cluster stability.

For more information, see [Longhorn Settings](../references/settings#instance-manager-pod-liveness-probe-timeout).

### Backing Image Manager CR Naming

Backing Image Manager CRs now use a compact, collision-resistant naming format to reduce conflict risk.

For details, see [Issue #11455](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/11455)

## Security

### Refined RBAC Permissions

RBAC permissions have been refined to minimize privileges and improve cluster security.

For details, see [Issue #11345](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/11345)

## V1 Data Engine

### IPv6 Support

V1 volumes now support single-stack IPv6 Kubernetes clusters.

> **Warning:** Dual-stack Kubernetes clusters and V2 volumes are not supported in this release.

For details, see [Issue #2259](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/2259).

## V2 Data Engine

### Longhorn System Upgrade

Live upgrades of V2 volumes are **not supported**. Ensure all V2 volumes are detached before upgrading.

### New Functionalities since Longhorn v1.10.0

#### V2 Data Engine Without Hugepage Support

The V2 Data Engine can run without Hugepage by setting `data-engine-hugepage-enabled` to `{"v2":"false"}`.

This reduces memory pressure on lowâ€‘spec nodes and increases deployment flexibility. Performance may be lower compared to running with Hugepage.

#### V2 Data Engine Interrupt Mode Support

Interrupt mode has been added to the V2 Data Engine to help reduce CPU usage. This feature is especially beneficial for clusters with idle or low I/O workloads, where conserving CPU resources is more important than minimizing latency.

While interrupt mode lowers CPU consumption, it may introduce slightly higher I/O latency compared to polling mode. In addition, the current implementation uses a hybrid approach, which still incurs a minimal, constant CPU load even when interrupts are enabled.

For more information, see [Interrupt Mode](../v2-data-engine/features/interrupt-mode) for more information.

#### V2 Data Engine Replica Rebuild QoS

Provides Quality of Service (QoS) control for V2 volume replica rebuilds. You can configure bandwidth limits globally or per volume to prevent storage throughput overload on source and destination nodes.

For more information, see [Replica Rebuild QoS](../v2-data-engine/features/replica-rebuild-qos).

#### V2 Data Engine Volume Expansion

Longhorn now supports volume expansion for V2 Data Engine volumes. Users can expand the volume through the UI or by modifying the PVC manifest.

For more information, see [V2 Volume Expansion](../v2-data-engine/features/volume-expansion).
