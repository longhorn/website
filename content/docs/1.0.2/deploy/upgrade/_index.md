Here we cover how to upgrade to latest Longhorn from all previous releases.

# Upgrading Longhorn

There are normally two steps in the upgrade process: first upgrade Longhorn manager to the latest version, then upgrade the Longhorn engine to the latest version using the latest Longhorn manager.

### 1. Upgrade Longhorn manager

- To upgrade from v1.0.0 or v1.0.1, see [this section.](./longhorn-manager)

### 2. Upgrade Longhorn Engine

After Longhorn Manager is upgraded, Longhorn Engine also needs to be upgraded [using the Longhorn UI.](./upgrade-engine)
