description: Install Longhorn on Kubernetes
weight: 1
---

Longhorn can be installed on a Kubernetes cluster in several ways:

- [kubectl](./install-with-kubectl/)
- [Helm](./install-with-helm/)
- [Rancher catalog app](./install-with-rancher)

To install Longhorn in an air gapped environment, refer to [this section.](../../advanced-resources/deploy/airgap)

For information on customizing Longhorn's default settings, refer to [this section.](../../advanced-resources/deploy/customizing-default-settings)

For information on deploying Longhorn on specific nodes and rejecting general workloads for those nodes, refer to the section on [taints and tolerations.](../../advanced-resources/deploy/taint-toleration)

# Installation Requirements

Each node in the Kubernetes cluster where Longhorn is installed must fulfill the following requirements:

-  Docker v1.13+
-  Kubernetes v1.14+.
    - By default Longhorn installation requires a three-nodes cluster since the default replica count is 3 and the [node level soft anti-affinity](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.0.0/references/settings/#replica-node-level-soft-anti-affinity) is disabled.
-  `open-iscsi` is installed, and the `iscsid` daemon is running on all the nodes. For help installing `open-iscsi`, refer to [this section.](#installing-open-iscsi)
- The host filesystem supports the `file extents` feature to store the data. Currently we support:
    - ext4
    - XFS
- `curl`, `findmnt`, `grep`, `awk`, `blkid`, `lsblk` must be installed.
- [Mount propagation](https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/deploying.html#enabling-mount-propagation) must be enabled.

CSI v1.1 is supported.

[This script](#using-the-environment-check-script) can be used to check the Longhorn environment for potential issues.

For the minimum recommended hardware, refer to the [best practices guide.](../../best-practices/#minimum-recommended-hardware)

### OS/Distro Specific Configuration

- **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)** requires some additional setup for Longhorn to function properly. If you're a GKE user, refer to [this section](../../advanced-resources/os-distro-specific/csi-on-gke) for details.
- **K3s clusters** require some extra setup. Refer to [this section](../../advanced-resources/os-distro-specific/csi-on-k3s)
- **RKE clusters with CoreOS** need [this configuration.](../../advanced-resources/os-distro-specific/csi-on-rke-and-coreos)

### Using the Environment Check Script

We've written a script to help you gather enough information about the factors. Before installing, run:

```shell
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/longhorn/longhorn/master/scripts/environment_check.sh | bash
```

Example result:

```shell
daemonset.apps/longhorn-environment-check created
waiting for pods to become ready (0/3)
all pods ready (3/3)

  MountPropagation is enabled!

cleaning up...
daemonset.apps "longhorn-environment-check" deleted
clean up complete
```

### Notes on Mount Propagation

If your Kubernetes cluster was provisioned by Rancher v2.0.7+ or later, the MountPropagation feature is enabled by default.

If MountPropagation is disabled, Base Image feature will be disabled.

### Installing open-iscsi

The command used to install `open-iscsi` differs depending on the Linux distribution.

For GKE, we recommend using Ubuntu as the guest OS image since it contains`open-iscsi` already.

You may need to edit the cluster security group to allow SSH access.

For Debian and Ubuntu, use this command:

```
apt-get install open-iscsi
```

For RHEL, CentOS, and EKS with `EKS Kubernetes Worker AMI with AmazonLinux2 image`, use this command:

```
yum install iscsi-initiator-utils
```


### Checking the Kubernetes Version

Use the following command to check your Kubernetes server version

```shell
kubectl version
```

Result:

```shell
Client Version: version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"10", GitVersion:"v1.10.3", GitCommit:"2bba0127d85d5a46ab4b778548be28623b32d0b0", GitTreeState:"clean", BuildDate:"2018-05-21T09:17:39Z", GoVersion:"go1.9.3", Compiler:"gc", Platform:"linux/amd64"}
Server Version: version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"10", GitVersion:"v1.10.1", GitCommit:"d4ab47518836c750f9949b9e0d387f20fb92260b", GitTreeState:"clean", BuildDate:"2018-04-12T14:14:26Z", GoVersion:"go1.9.3", Compiler:"gc", Platform:"linux/amd64"}
```

The `Server Version` should be `v1.10` or above.
