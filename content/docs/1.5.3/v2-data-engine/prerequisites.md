## Prerequisites

Longhorn nodes must meet the following requirements:

- x86-64 CPU with SSE4.2 instruction support
  > **NOTICE**
  >
  > Currently, V2 Data Engine only supports `x86_64` platform.

- Linux kernel

  5.13 or later is required for NVMe over TCP support


- Linux kernel modules
  - uio
  - uio_pci_generic
  - nvme-tcp

- Huge page support
  - 1 GiB of 2 MiB-sized pages

## Notice

### CPU

When the V2 Data Engine is enabled, each instance-manager pod utilizes **1 CPU core**. This high CPU usage is attributed to the `spdk_tgt` process running within each instance-manager pod. The spdk_tgt process is responsible for handling input/output (IO) operations and requires intensive polling. As a result, it consumes 100% of a dedicated CPU core to efficiently manage and process the IO requests, ensuring optimal performance and responsiveness for storage operations.

### Memory

SPDK utilizes huge pages to enhance performance and minimize memory overhead. To enable the usage of huge pages, it is necessary to configure 2MiB-sized huge pages on each Longhorn node. Specifically, **512 pages (equivalent to a total of 1 GiB)** need to be available on each Longhorn node.


### Disk

**Local NVMe disks** are highly recommended for optimal storage performance of volumes using V2 Data Engine.
