A [snapshot](../../concepts/#24-snapshots) is the state of a Kubernetes Volume at any given point in time. 

To create a snapshot of an existing cluster,

1. In the top navigation bar of the Longhorn UI, click **Volume.**
2. Click the name of the volume of which you want a snapshot. This leads to the volume detail page.
3. Click the **Take Snapshot** button

Once the snapshot is created you'll see it in the list of snapshots for the volume prior to the Volume Head.
