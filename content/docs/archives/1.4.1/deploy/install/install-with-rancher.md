One benefit of installing Longhorn through Rancher Apps & Marketplace is that Rancher provides authentication to the Longhorn UI.

If there is a new version of Longhorn available, you will see an `Upgrade Available` sign on the `Apps & Marketplace` screen. You can click `Upgrade` button to upgrade Longhorn manager. See more about upgrade [here](../../upgrade).

## Prerequisites

Each node in the Kubernetes cluster where Longhorn is installed must fulfill [these requirements.](../#installation-requirements)

[This script](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/blob/v{{< current-version >}}/scripts/environment_check.sh) can be used to check the Longhorn environment for potential issues.

## Installation

> **Note**:
> * For Kubernetes < v1.25, if your cluster still enables Pod Security Policy admission controller, set `Other Settings > Pod Security Policy` to `true` to install `longhorn-psp` PodSecurityPolicy resource which allows privileged Longhorn pods to start.

1. Optional: If Rancher version is 2.5.9 or before, we recommend creating a new project for Longhorn, for example, `Storage`.
2. Navigate to the cluster where you will install Longhorn.
