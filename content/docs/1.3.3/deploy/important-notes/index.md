This page lists important notes for Longhorn v{{< current-version >}}.
Please see [here](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/releases/tag/v{{< current-version >}}) for the full release note.

## Notes
1. We introduce a new setting [Node Drain Policy](../../references/settings#node-drain-policy) which will deprecate the old setting [Allow Node Drain with the Last Healthy Replica](../../references/settings#allow-node-drain-with-the-last-healthy-replica), so it is recommended to keep the old setting [Allow Node Drain with the Last Healthy Replica](../../references/settings#allow-node-drain-with-the-last-healthy-replica) as default `false` value and use the new setting [Node Drain Policy](../../references/settings#node-drain-policy) which has more options and controls.
2. Please ensure your Kubernetes cluster is at least v1.18 and at most v1.24 before upgrading to Longhorn v{{< current-version >}} because the supported Kubernetes version has been updated (>= v1.18 and <= v1.24) in v{{< current-version >}}.
2. After the upgrade, the recurring job settings of volumes will be migrated to new recurring job resources, and the `RecurringJobs` field in the volume spec will be deprecated. [[doc](https://longhorn.io/docs/{{< current-version >}}/deploy/upgrade/#4-automatically-migrate-recurring-jobs)]
3. When upgrading from a Longhorn version >= 1.2.0 and <= v1.2.3 to v{{< current-version >}}, if your cluster has many backups, you may expect to have a long upgrade time (with 22000 backups, it could take a few hours). Helm upgrade may timeout and you may need to re-run the upgrade command or set a longer timeout. This is [a known issue](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/3890)
4. There are two important fixes that will prevent rarely potential data corruption during replica rebuilding, and also improve write performance via the specific filesystem block size.
   - [4354](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/4354): Introduce Data Alignment Correction for existing volumes if the filesystem block size is less than 4096.
   - [4594](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/4594): Use the specific block size for the filesystem to avoid unnecessary Ready-Modify-Write operations between volume head and snapshots.
5. After the upgrade, the behavior of the recurring job types `Snapshot` and `Backup` will attempt to delete old snapshots first if they exceed the retained count before creating a new snapshot. Additionally, two new recurring job types have been introduced, `Snapshot Force Create` and `Backup Force Create`. They retain the original behavior of taking a snapshot or backup first before deleting outdated snapshots.
