title: Node Conditions

Node conditions describe the status of all worker nodes and are used to check the environment settings of worker nodes to identify potential issues before any system impact.

Node conditions:

- `Ready`:  
  Indicates that the node is ready for Longhorn operations, including that a `longhorn-manager` pod is running on this node, the Kubernetes node is ready, and there is no physical resources pressure.  

- `Schedulable`:  
  Indicated that the node is not cordoned and workload can be scheduled to this node.

- `MountPropagation`:  
  Indicates that the node supports mount propagation. This is necessary for sharing of volumes mounted by a container with other containers in the same Longhorn pod, or to other Longhorn pods on the same node.  

- `Multipathd`:  
  Confirms if the `multipathd` service is not running on the node, which may affect the pod with the volume startup. See [Troubleshooting: `MountVolume.SetUp failed for volume` due to multipathd on the node](../../../../../kb/troubleshooting-volume-with-multipath).  

- `RequiredPackages`:  
  Checks if all required packages ([NFS client](../../../deploy/install/#installing-nfsv4-client), [iSCSI tool](../../../deploy/install/#installing-open-iscsi), [cryptsetup](../../../deploy/install/#installing-cryptsetup-and-luks), [dmsetup](../../../deploy/install/#installing-device-mapper-userspace-tool)) exist for Longhorn  

- `NFSClientInstalled`:  
  Identifies if any of the following NFS clients are supported: `v4.2`, `v4.1`, or `v4.0`. NFS client is required for RWX volume and backup.  

- `KernelModulesLoaded`:  
  Identifies if the following Kernel modules are loaded:
  - `dm_crypt`: Is required for the volume and backing image encryption.  

Node conditions do not block the Longhorn deployment but they result in warnings in the Longhorn `Node` resource.
