In this section, you'll learn how to install Longhorn with Helm.

### Prerequisites

- Each node in the Kubernetes cluster where Longhorn will be installed must fulfill [these requirements.](../#installation-requirements)
- Helm v2.0+ must be installed on your workstation.

[This script](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/blob/master/scripts/environment_check.sh) can be used to check the Longhorn environment for potential issues.

The initial settings for Longhorn can be [customized using Helm options or by editing the deployment configuration file.](../../../advanced-resources/deploy/customizing-default-settings/#using-helm)

#### Notes on Installing Helm

For help installing Helm, refer to the [official documentation.](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)

If you're using a Helm version prior to version 3.0, you need to [install Tiller in your Kubernetes cluster with role-based access control (RBAC)](https://v2.helm.sh/docs/using_helm/#tiller-namespaces-and-rbac).

### Installing Longhorn

1. Clone the Longhorn repository:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn && cd longorn
    ```

2. Install Longhorn in the `longhorn-system` namespace.
    To install Longhorn with Helm 2, use this command:

    ```
    helm install ./longhorn/chart --name longhorn --namespace longhorn-system
    ```

    To install Longhorn with Helm 3, use these commands:

    ```
    kubectl create namespace longhorn-system
    helm install longhorn ./longhorn/chart/ --namespace longhorn-system
    ```

3. To confirm that the deployment succeeded, run:

    ```bash
    kubectl -n longhorn-system get pod
    ```
    The result should look like the following:

    ```bash

4. To enable access to the Longhorn UI, you will need to set up an Ingress controller. Authentication to the Longhorn UI is not enabled by default. For information on creating an NGINX Ingress controller with basic authentication, refer to [this section.](../../accessing-the-ui/longhorn-ingress)
