A backup target represents a backupstore in Longhorn. The backup target can be set at `Settings/General/BackupTarget`

See [here](../../users-guide/backup-and-restore/backupstores-and-backuptargets) for details on how to setup backup target.


Longhorn also supports setting up recurring snapshot/backup jobs for volumes, via Longhorn UI or Kubernetes Storage Class. See [here](../../users-guide/backup-and-restore/scheduling-backups-and-snapshots) for details.
