Backups in Longhorn are snapshots that are moved off-cluster into a BackupStore.  A Backup of a snapshot is copied to the a targeted BackupStore, this is called a BackupTarget.  

To setup a BackupTarget see [Set the BackupTarget](../backupstores-and-backuptargets#set-backuptarget).

For Informtion regarding BackupStores see [Setup a BackupStore](../backupstores-and-backuptargets#set-backuptarget)

To create a backup

- Navigate to the Volume menu
- Select the volume you wish to Backup
- Click Create Backup
- Add any appropriate labels and click OK

If the BackupTarget has not been set you'll be presented with an error.

Otherwise, once the backup is created it will be seen in the Backup menu.
