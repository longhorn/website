## Quick Start

1. Helm 3.0+
2. Docker v1.13+
3. Kubernetes v1.14+ cluster with 1 or more nodes and Mount Propagation feature enabled. If your Kubernetes cluster was provisioned by Rancher v2.0.7+ or later, MountPropagation feature is enabled by default. [Check your Kubernetes environment now](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/#environment-check-script). If MountPropagation is disabled, Base Image feature will be disabled.
4. Make sure `curl`, `findmnt`, `grep`, `awk` and `blkid` has been installed in all nodes of the Kubernetes cluster.
5.  `open-iscsi` has been installed on all the nodes of the Kubernetes cluster, and `iscsid` daemon is running on all the nodes.
    1. For GKE, recommended Ubuntu as guest OS image since it contains open-iscsi already.
    2. For Debian/Ubuntu, use `apt-get install open-iscsi` to install.
    3. For RHEL/CentOS, use `yum install iscsi-initiator-utils` to install.
    4. For EKS with `EKS Kubernetes Worker AMI with AmazonLinux2 image`, 
       use `yum install iscsi-initiator-utils` to install. You may need to edit cluster security group to allow ssh access.
6. A host filesystem supports `file extents` feature on the nodes to store the data. Currently we support:
    1. ext4
    2. XFS

{{< requirement title="Helm setup" >}}
To install Longhorn using Helm, you first need to [install Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) locally. If you're using a version prior to version 3.0, you need to [install Tiller into your Kubernetes cluster with role-based access control (RBAC)](https://v2.helm.sh/docs/using_helm/#tiller-namespaces-and-rbac).
{{< /requirement >}}

Once you have Helm installed, clone the Longhorn repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn && cd longhorn
```

Use this `helm` command to install Longhorn:

```shell
helm install ./longhorn/chart --name longhorn --namespace longhorn-system
```

This installs Longorn in the `longhorn-system` namespace.

A successful CSI-based deployment looks like this:

```shell
kubectl -n longhorn-system get pod

## Accessing the UI

Once Longhorn has been installed in your Kubernetes cluster, you can access the UI dashboard by getting its external service IP and navigating to it in your browser:

```shell
kubectl -n longhorn-system get svc
```

The output should look something like this:

```shell
NAME                TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP      PORT(S)        AGE
longhorn-backend    ClusterIP      10.20.248.250   <none>           9500/TCP       58m
longhorn-frontend   LoadBalancer   10.20.245.110   100.200.200.123  80:30697/TCP   58m
```

In the example above, the public IP is `100.200.200.123`.

{{< warning title="No authentication by default" >}}
If you installed Longhorn using the [kubectl instructions](../../install/install-with-kubectl) above, the Longhorn UI does not require authentication.

### Access the UI

The Longhorn UI looks like this:
